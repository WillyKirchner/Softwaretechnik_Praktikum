### Running the project in IntelliJ

- Clone the project from GitHub
- Open IntelliJ > File > Open
- Now search for the ``pom.xml`` file in your cloned project
- Open it as a project

### Web documentation of all API endpoints

Open http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html in your browser. You should now be able to see and test all endpoints.

### Changing the standard port

In case you are running another application that is already using port 8080:
- go to src > main > resources > application.properties
- change **server.port** to some other port
